description: 'Retaining information in working memory (WM) is a demanding process
  that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
  from interference. How cognitive control regulates WM storage, however, remains
  unknown. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent
  activity are coordinated by theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded
  single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients maintained
  multiple items in WM. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of WM load and quality.
  We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta
  phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
  with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
  noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons
  shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations
  of WM content that were associated with improved behavior. Our results support a
  multicomponent architecture of WM, with frontal control managing maintenance of
  WM content in storage-related areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates
  cognitive control and WM storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
  mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.
